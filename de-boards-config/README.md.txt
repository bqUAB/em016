# DE Boards Configuration Files

Directory that holds the configuration files for the DE boards used in the
design of the project. Only the needed files to replicate the Quartus project
have been provided to avoid filling the repository with non helpful files.

To use these files as a starting point for further development, the user needs
to create a new project and import the corresponding files. As a result, it is
also expected that collaborators provide the same files when uploading a change
or an improvement to these configurations.
